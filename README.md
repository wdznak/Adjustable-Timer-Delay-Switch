# Adjustable-Timer-Delay-Switch

Timer with 4-Digit 7-Segment Display. It controls 230V AC Relay with 12V DC. The heart of the system is ATmega328p and it is the only new element. All other parts are recovered from old electronic devices. The display is controlled by 8-bit shift register M74HC595. This project was designed from scratch by myself and I did not use any blueprints. For prototyping, I used Arduino Uno.
